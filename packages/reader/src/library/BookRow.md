# BookRow Component Notes

## Author Display Feature

### Implementation
- Added author display next to book title in the same row
- Author text is displayed in smaller, gray text (`text-gray-500 text-xs`)
- Uses same `highlightText` function to highlight search matches in author names
- Follows prototype styling from `packages/reader/prototype/library/LibraryPrototype.tsx`

### Search Integration
- Author field is now searchable via `BookDatabase.searchBooks()`
- SQL query updated to match on both title and author fields: `WHERE LOWER(title) LIKE ? OR LOWER(author) LIKE ?`
- Search highlighting works for both title and author text

### Layout
- Title and author are displayed inline with `flex items-baseline gap-2`
- Author uses `truncate` class to handle long names
- Uses nullish coalescing (`??`) to handle missing author data gracefully
