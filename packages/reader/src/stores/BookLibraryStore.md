# BookLibraryStore Refactoring Notes

## Changes Made

1. **Optional DB Parameter**: The `create()` method now accepts an optional `db` parameter. If not provided, it fetches the shared instance from `DatabaseProvider.getDb()`.

2. **Close Method**: Modified to NOT close the SQLiteDB instance, as it's now shared across the application. Only closes the BlobStore which is specific to this store.

## Important Considerations

- The `close()` method no longer closes the SQLite connection
- For complete cleanup (e.g., in tests), use `closeDb()` from DatabaseProvider
- The store still holds a reference to the SQLiteDB instance for backwards compatibility, but doesn't manage its lifecycle

## Migration Path for Existing Code

```typescript
// Old pattern
const store = await BookLibraryStore.create();

// New pattern (still works, uses shared db)
const store = await BookLibraryStore.create();

// New pattern (explicit db)
const db = await getDb();
const store = await BookLibraryStore.create(db);
```
